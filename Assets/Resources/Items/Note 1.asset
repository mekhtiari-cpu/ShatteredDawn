  info: I've left the city. I knew you'd come looking so I left you this note- brothers
    know best. I heard there's a broken truck in the city, used to belong to Old
    Man Jenkins. He's living in one of these buildings. Find him, and ask for the
    key. If you want to reach me, fix the truck, and drive North. You can do it -
    I'm waiting for you.
